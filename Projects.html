        		<h1>Ph.D. Project [2014 - present]</h1>
				<p> <b> Development of a high accuracy and low power Star Tracker for nano-satellites </b> under <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/eechenss/" target="_blank"> Assistant Professor Shoushun Chen </a> at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. Tasks involved:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
		    <li>Development of a <b> novel star pattern recognition technique </b> which gives high accuracy in an ideal case. </li><p/>			
		    <li>The developed pattern recognition technique must also be <b>robust</b> to the cases when there missing stars, random stars, positional deviation in the image captured by the image sensor mounted on the satellite. </li>
		    <li>The developed pattern recognition must also consume less time and provide a fast search in the star pattern database.</li>
		    <li>The developed pattern recognition technique has to be implemented on an FPGA and a high accuracy, low power star tracker prototype has to be developed.</li>

			<h2>Undergraduate Final Year Project [January-May, 2014] </h2>
			<p> <b> Modifying Cache Replacement Algorithm in Multicore Systems </b> under <a href="https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/cse/faculty/nrs/" target="_blank"> Prof. Dr. N. Ramasubramanian </a> at National Institute of Technology (NIT), Tiruchirappalli, India. Tasks involved:</p>
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  				<li>Observing the behavior of existing data eviction algorithm on Cache simulator called <b>CACTI </b>. </li><p/>			
		    <li>Implemented existing algorithms and simulated the same behavior using C++ as the platform. </li>
			<li>Development of a new algorithm which included both the <b>frequency</b> of hits and the <b> time </b> of the recent history of hits.</li>
				</ul>
				
			<h3> Summer Research Internship 2013 (DAAD Fellowship 2013) </h3>
			<p> <b>  Development of a Translator v2NuSMV: Translates from a subset of Verilog HDL into the input language of Open Source Formal Verification Tool NuSMV </b> under <a href="http://www.professoren.tum.de/en/schlichtmann-ulf/" target="_blank"> Prof. Dr. Ulf. Schlichtmann </a> guided by <a href="https://www.eda.ei.tum.de/personen/alessandro-bernardini/" target="_blank"> M.Sc. Alessandro Bernardini </a> at <a href="https://www.eda.ei.tum.de/lehrveranstaltungen/vorlesungen/electronic-design-automation/" target="_blank"> Department of Electronic Design and Automation </a> at Technical University of Munich, Germany. Tasks involved:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:square">
					<li> <b>Parsing </b> the netlist, <b>extraction </b> and storing of the required information in the classes, converting and <b>recovering </b> the stored information into the input language of NuSMV. </li><p/>			
					<li>The translation was carried out with reference to the <b>NangateOpenCellLibrary </b> and using the <b>lex</b> and <b>yacc</b> tools of Python.  </li>
					<li>Eventually the translator was developed and successfully translated any <b>n-bit binary counter</b> and a <b>Traffic Light Controller</b> described in Verilog HDL. </li>
					<li>Currently work is under extension for including a <b>larger subset</b> of Verilog HDL. (Please contact me if interested to pursue). </li>
				</ul>

Tasks involved:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:square">
					<li> <b>Design</b> and <b>Simulation</b> of the proposed analog firing circuit of Silicon Controlled Rectifiers in MultiSim and PSPICE.</li><p/>			
					<li> Development of <b>hardware circuitry</b> of the proposed design for Firing circuitry, Isolation circuitry and Power circuitry.   </li>
					<li> Verifying the <b>reliability of the circuit</b> by operating the hardware circuit for firing the SCRs at the desired firing angle and comparing the practical results with that of the simulation.  </li>
					<li> Development of <b>Single Phase</b> and <b>Three Phase </b> AC-DC converters using the prototype developed. </li>
