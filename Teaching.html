			<h2>Teaching Assistant</h2>
				<p>Teaching Assistant (TA) for Year 2 Undergraduate Course - Engineering Mathematics II (EE2007) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore [2017]. <br/>
  				EE2007 course consists of intermediate level linear algebra, complex integration, and vector calculus. It was an enriching first time experience to make the Year 2 undergraduate students understand the basic concepts and solve tricky problems. Visualization of mathematics is a key to understanding it, which was the most crucial part for me to explain it to the students during this course.<p/>			
				
			<h3>Final Year Project (FYP) Guide 2016-17 - Development of a Star Tracker Baffle</h3>
				<p>Guided a FYP student, Ms. Chua Jia Ying whose project was "Development of a Star Tracker Baffle". A baffle is used to prevent stray light (sun rays, moon light) from entering the field of view of the image sensor.  This project involved a deep understanding of ray optics, tracing and 3D design (done in GoogleSketchUp). Later part of the project was to test the effectiveness of the baffle developed, which involved building the testing setup consisting of a sun simulator and sun sensor.<p/>
